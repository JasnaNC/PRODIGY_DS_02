## DataScience Task-2
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

## Introduction
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis(EDA) on the Titanic dataset.

## Dataset
The titanic dataset consists of 12 features which are,
- PassengerId: A unique identifier for each passenger.
- Survived: A binary feature indicating whether the passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0) the disaster.
- Pclass: The passenger class, which is a proxy for socio-economic status. There are three classes: 1st class (luxury), 2nd class (middle class), and 3rd class (economy).
- Name: The passenger's full name.
- Sex: The passenger's gender, either male or female.
- Age: The passenger's age in years.
- SibSp: The number of siblings and spouses the passenger had on board.
- Parch: The number of parents and children the passenger had on board.
- Ticket: The ticket number, which can be used to identify the passenger's travel group.
- Fare: The fare paid by the passenger in British pounds.
- Cabin: The cabin number, which can be used to identify the passenger's accommodation.
- Embarked: The port of embarkation, which is either Southampton (S), Cherbourg (C), or Queenstown (Q).

## Methods used 
To investigate the impact of various factors on the survival and non-survival of Titanic passengers, we employed a range of visualization techniques, including histograms, pie charts, box plots, and correlation matrices, to uncover key insights from the dataset.

## Conclusion
This repository  explored the Titanic dataset to identify the key factors influencing the survival and non-survival of passengers. Through a combination of visualization techniques including histograms, pie charts, box plots and correlation matrices which uncovered significant insights into the relationships between various factors and passenger outcomes. These findings suggest that features like  class, age, and gender played significant roles in determining survival rates. These results provide a deeper understanding of the Titanic tragedy and can inform strategies for improving passenger safety in similar maritime disasters. Ultimately, this analysis demonstrates the power of data visualization in uncovering hidden patterns and relationships in complex dataset.
